# Asset-Management-System
Siddharth Chandrasekar, 2017

A web-based asset management system built for my college. I built this project during my "Software Package Development" course in college. It was
a special project assigned to me by my programme co-ordinator. The intention was to build an asset management system to replace the college's
existing asset tracking system (which was really really old).

I have included all the PHP code files here. I haven't included any of the Database files or any of the site assets as they contain sensitive information that I am not allowed to share (Including login information of faculty in the college).

NOTE: The code in these files may not be properly indented. The indentations got messed up when I was copying the contents of the files.
I normally take very good care to indent my code properly. Please forgive me if it hurts your OCD (It definitely hurts mine :-P)

Please do not copy or plagiarize my work. You may view the code for reference, but please cite my repo as a source if you do.
